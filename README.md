A data enthusiast captivated by the boundless potential of the data universe, where remarkable feats are achieved through the power of computers and artificial intelligence (machine learning and deep learning).

Currently completing a Analysis and Systems Development degree at Descomplica (SÃ£o Paulo University), I am drawn to the realm of data visualization, a field in which I have immersed myself for approximately a year. Driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to contribute to the advancement of this domain, I actively seek opportunities to propel my career and personal growth.

Skilled in Python, Power BI, SQL, Excel, and problem-solving, I am eager to apply my expertise and gain valuable experience in the field of data visualization.
